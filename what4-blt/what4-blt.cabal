Synopsis:      What4 bindings to BLT
Description:
  BLT is a library the solves bounded integer linear programs by
  reducing the problem to bounded lattice search.  This package
  provides support for lowering Crucible formulae to linear systems
  of the sort understood by BLT, and for executing the underlying solver.

What4 is a library for representing symbolic terms and communicating with
satisfiability and SMT solvers (e.g. Yices and Z3).

It was originally a part of the Crucible (https://github.com/GaloisInc/crucible)
project, but has found use cases that are independent of its original
purpose as the representation language for the Crucible symbolic
simulator, and has thus been split out into a separate repository.

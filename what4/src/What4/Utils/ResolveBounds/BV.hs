    -- The general strategy for finding a bound is that we start searching
    -- from a particular value known to be within bounds. At each step, we
    -- change this value by exponentially increasing amount, then check if we
    -- have exceeded the bound by using the solver. If so, we then fall back to
    -- binary search to determine an exact bound. If we are within bounds, we
    -- repeat the process.
    --
    -- As an example, let's suppose we having a symbolic value with bounds of
    -- [0, 12], and we start searching for the upper bound at the value 1:
    --
    -- * In the first step, we add 1 to the starting value to get 2. We check
    --   if two has exceeded the upper bound using the solver. This is not the
    --   case, so we continue.
    -- * In the second step, we add 2 to the starting value. The result, 3,
    --   is within bounds.
    -- * We continue like this in the third and fourth steps, except that
    --   we add 4 and 8 to the starting value to get 5 and 9, respectively.
    -- * In the fifth step, we add 16 to the starting value. The result, 17,
    --   has exceeded the upper bound. We will now fall back to binary search,
    --   using the previous result (9) as the leftmost bounds of the search and
    --   the current result (17) as the rightmost bounds of the search.
    -- * Eventually, binary search discovers that 12 is the upper bound.
    --
    -- Note that at each step, we must also check to make sure that the amount
    -- to increase the starting value by does not cause a numeric overflow. If
    -- this would be the case, we fall back to binary search, using
    -- BV.maxUnsigned as the rightmost bounds of the search.
    --
    -- The process for finding a lower bound is quite similar, except that we
    -- /subtract/ an exponentially increasing amount from the starting value
    -- each time rather than adding it.
